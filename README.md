It contains basic game-mechanics like:

- player movement

- collecting stuff, shooting, ...

- enemy movement (Area2D)

- player physics (KinematicBody2D)

- animations

- camera 2D

- parallax background

- scene switching (level switching)

- HUD (with additional touch controll buttons)

- using globals

The game consists of a menu and three levels. The enemies in the levels should be dodged to avoid a game-over. In the third level, the player can shoot. The levels are finished by collecting the red rubies.

The game offers keyboard controls as well as touch controls for mobile devices.
